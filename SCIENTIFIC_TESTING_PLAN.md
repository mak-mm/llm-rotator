## Testing Metrics & Validation

### 1. Privacy Preservation Metrics

#### **Primary Metrics**
```python
Privacy Score Accuracy = |Calculated_Score - Ground_Truth_Score| / Ground_Truth_Score
PII Leakage Rate = Detected_PII_in_Fragments / Total_PII_in_Query
Fragment Isolation = 1 - (Shared_Context_Tokens / Total_Context_Tokens)
```

#### **Secondary Metrics**
- K-Anonymity compliance (k ≥ 2 for all fragments)
- L-Diversity validation (attribute diversity preservation)
- Information theory: H(Fragment) < H(Original_Query)

### 2. Response Quality Metrics

#### **Coherence Scoring**
```python
# Semantic Similarity (using sentence transformers)
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def semantic_coherence(original_intent, aggregated_response):
    similarity = model.encode([original_intent, aggregated_response])
    return cosine_similarity(similarity[0], similarity[1])

# Response Completeness
def completeness_score(expected_elements, response):
    found_elements = count_present_elements(expected_elements, response)
    return found_elements / len(expected_elements)
```

#### **Quality Improvement Metrics**
- **Before vs After**: Pre-enhancement baseline vs enhanced system
- **Confidence Score Accuracy**: Predicted quality vs human evaluation
- **Error Rate Reduction**: Fewer nonsensical responses

### 3. Performance Metrics

#### **Latency Analysis**
```python
Processing_Time_Distribution = {
    "p50": "median processing time",
    "p95": "95th percentile processing time", 
    "p99": "99th percentile processing time"
}

Target_SLA = {
    "simple_queries": "< 2 seconds",
    "medium_queries": "< 5 seconds", 
    "complex_queries": "< 10 seconds"
}
```

#### **Cost Efficiency**
```python
Cost_Per_Query = Sum(Provider_Costs) / Query_Count
Savings_Rate = (Single_Provider_Cost - Fragmented_Cost) / Single_Provider_Cost
ROI = Privacy_Value_Score × Savings_Rate
```

### 4. Provider Performance Analysis

#### **Provider Utilization**
```python
Provider_Quality_Score = {
    "anthropic": Confidence_Score_Average,
    "openai": Confidence_Score_Average,
    "google": Confidence_Score_Average
}

Optimal_Distribution = {
    "high_privacy": "anthropic_preferred",
    "balanced": "mixed_providers",
    "cost_effective": "google_preferred"
}
```

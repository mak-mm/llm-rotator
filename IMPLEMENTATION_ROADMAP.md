# Implementation Roadmap: Privacy-Preserving LLM Query Fragmentation PoC

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines a 4-week implementation plan for building a demonstration-ready Privacy-Preserving LLM Query Fragmentation system. The system will fragment user queries across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) to ensure no single provider sees complete context, while maintaining response quality and sub-2 second performance.

## Timeline Overview

- **Week 1**: Project Setup & Core Detection Engine
- **Week 2**: Basic Fragmentation & Provider Integration  
- **Week 3**: Orchestrator & Intelligence Layer
- **Week 4**: Demo UI & Performance Optimization

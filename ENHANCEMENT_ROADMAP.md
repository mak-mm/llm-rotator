# Privacy-Preserving LLM Query Fragmentation - Enhancement Roadmap

## Current Status (Working PoC)

✅ **Achieved (v1.0)**:
- Real PII/code detection (Presidio, Guesslang, spaCy)
- Multi-provider fragmentation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Privacy score calculation (0.95 achieved)
- Cost tracking and optimization
- End-to-end orchestrator workflow

## Identified Issues

### 1. **Response Aggregation Quality** (Critical)
**Problem**: LLMs confused by placeholder fragments
```
Current: "Sorry, but I can't assist with that..."
Expected: Coherent GDPR compliance advice
```

### 2. **Fragment Strategy Tuning** (High)
**Problem**: Over-fragmentation of simple queries
- 4 fragments for basic PII query may be excessive
- Fragment content needs better contextual instructions

### 3. **Response Coherence** (High)
**Problem**: Fragments don't aggregate meaningfully
- Individual fragments lack sufficient context
- Aggregation logic needs improvement

### 4. **Frontend Integration** (Medium)
**Problem**: Placeholder fragment content display
```
Current: "Fragment processed by openai"
Needed: Actual fragment content and responses
```

### 5. **Error Handling** (Medium)
**Problem**: No graceful degradation
- Single fragment failure affects entire response
- No fallback strategies implemented

## Enhancement Plan

confidence_score = (
    length_score * 0.2 +           # Response length appropriateness
    time_score * 0.1 +             # Processing efficiency 
    privacy_score * 0.3 +          # Privacy alignment
    coherence_score * 0.3 +        # Response coherence
    type_appropriateness * 0.1     # Fragment type matching
)
```

**Impact**: Eliminates low-quality responses, prioritizes coherent aggregation

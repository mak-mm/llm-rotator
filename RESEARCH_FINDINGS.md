# Privacy-Preserving Query Fragmentation: Research Findings & Best Practices

## Executive Summary

This document presents comprehensive research findings on privacy-preserving query fragmentation, anonymization techniques, and response aggregation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs). The research covers three critical areas: privacy preservation techniques, multi-party computation approaches, and ensemble methods for response aggregation.

**Implementation Note**: Our system builds upon Microsoft Presidio as the foundational PII detection engine, enhanced with novel semantic anonymization and context-preserving fragmentation strategies documented in this research.

## 1. Privacy-Preserving Query Fragmentation Best Practices

### 1.1 Core Anonymization Framework

**Three-Stage Process**:
1. **Preprocessing**: Prepare raw data for analysis
2. **Identification**: Detect PII using DLP software and ML models
3. **Anonymization**: Replace PII with anonymous substitutes

### 1.2 Advanced Anonymization Techniques

#### **Generalization**
- Replace precise data values with more general representations
- Example: "John Doe, 32" → "Person, 30-40 age range"

#### **Differential Privacy**
- Add calculated noise to datasets while preserving statistical properties
- Provides mathematical guarantees against re-identification

#### **Masking & Pseudonymization**
- Obscure portions of sensitive data
- Replace PII with consistent, non-identifiable placeholders
- Maintain reference integrity across interactions

#### **LLM-Based Rewriting**
- Use LLMs to rewrite text while preserving meaning
- Superior to simple masking as it maintains context
- Generates new text omitting private data but retaining relevance

### 1.3 State-of-the-Art Frameworks

#### **Hide and Seek (HaS) Framework**
- **Hide-Model**: Anonymizes private entities
- **Seek-Model**: De-anonymizes responses when needed
- Bidirectional approach for controlled privacy

#### **LLM Guard (Protect AI)**
- Anonymizes input data to prevent PII leakage
- De-anonymizes responses to restore sanitized attributes
- Includes prompt injection attack defense

#### **Local Privacy-Preserving Solutions**
- Browser-based front ends with local LLM backends
- Process medical records and extract PII locally
